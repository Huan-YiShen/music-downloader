# music-downloader
It's 2 am, wifi is down, and I just want to listen to something nice :)

## Python dev note (it's been a while)
`$ python -m venv venv` (first venv indicate the venv module, second venv is the name of your virtual environment, can be anything)
`$ venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (windows only)  <br>
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
`$ deactivate` (to exit the venv)


Scripts that you can run <br>
`$ python downloader.py`


export new requirements <br>
`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`
